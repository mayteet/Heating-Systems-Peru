# Technical Feasibility of Heating Systems and ACS in mining camps of Peru located in the mountains


The mining camps located in the mountains are in areas of high solar potential, which is an opportunity to diversify their matrix of energy consumption, and tax and economic benefits. Of the 570 mining projects that are in the production stage, 52.45% are located in the highlands of Peru. In these areas the average daily solar radiation is between 5 and 6 kWh/m2, values considered high.

This research seeks to analyze the economic technical feasibility of implementing a sanitary hot water and heating system taking advantage of the solar resource for the Tuctu mining camp, located in Morococha, Peru at about 4000 meters above sea level. For this, a study of the meteorological variables of interest is carried out, such as: global solar radiation on a horizontal surface, maximum, minimum, and average temperatures, wind speed and direction. Besides, a thermal demand calculation was made to size the compoments of the propose. Finally, the TIR and VAN were calculated as main KPIs of the economic feasibility. 

# Disclamer: This researc his made in aims of study. There were many considerations taking into consideration. The information and data taken was from public datasources. No sensible information about Morococha is shared.
